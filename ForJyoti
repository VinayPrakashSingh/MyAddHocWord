1.	What knowledge of Genpact's systems, applications, methodologies and/or procedures does the employee possess that a non-Genpact employee would not possess? 
•	Genpact propritery Multi Outlet (MULO) solutions for media lift
•	Knowledge on IRI Retailers data, Frequency Shopper Program, Point of Sale, Experian
•	Design and Implementation of business methodologies using advance knowledge of open source softwares R, Julia, Python, Hadoop, 
Hive, UNIX Shell Scripting and integration of multiple technologies and data exchange to deploy solution.
•	Visualization tools Tableau, R Shiny and DB platform SQL Server.

2.	Does employee work on a Genpact proprietary application, system, technology or methodology?  If yes, please explain in detail and 
describe how it is proprietary. 
•	Yes, I have designed and developed MULO methodology for media lift studies. Media lift team delivers ROI due to impact of
ads targeted for a UPCs or brand in US market. It primarily uses exposure and FSP (Frequency Shopper Program) data from retailers 
across US. IRI provides access of FSP data for few retailers from four outlets and providing lift using only those outlets gives 
biased ROI. Getting FSP data for all the retailers is costly so Genpact has developed MULO methodology which uses sales information 
from POS and NCP and uses projection methodology to calculate lift for the missing outlets which helps providing ROI for majority of 
outlets in US.

3.	If employee does not work on a proprietary application, does he work on an off-the-shelf application which is customized for Genpact?
If so, explain in detail the nature and complexity of the specialized customization for Genpact.

NA


4.	Explain how employee's specialized knowledge is significantly different from the knowledge generally applied by other practitioners 
in the field of activity.

•	I have better understanding of all available FSP retailers and operating outlets in US market. This helped me lay out the rules for 
MULO and having good knowledge of open source softwares, I could implement the methodology, which others can use and deliver the results. 
Most of the other team members in MCoE does not know one or other. 


5.	How is the employee’s specialized knowledge more advanced than basic or elementary knowledge?
•	I am more close to POS and FSP retailers and developed data prep for media lift studies. I am also continuously part of lift delivery
and explaining those to onshore. This gradually developed in-depth understanding of FSP/POS data, ad-agencies programs and lift. 
This helped me being core member of new FSP data acquisition, developing and managing existing products with the help of evolving open
source in market.

6.	What specific Genpact training has employee completed?   Please include copies of all relevant certificates.
•	Tableau
•	Julia
•	C++
•	R
•	Python
•	Hadoop technologies
•	Lift methodologies


7.	What is the aim or goal of your client engagement?  What does the client hope to gain by partnering with Genpact?
•	Media lift methodology has evolved over last 3-4 years because of more understanding on product, competitive methodologies, 
growing data size, newer open source to handle such data. Gradual change in methodology needs to be researched and validated. 

8.	Why was employee selected for this assignment?
•	Because of understanding of Media Lift dataset, Lift methodologies and changes over past, MULO behavior and open source, 
employee is selected to support the product and research on newer products.

9.	How is this specialized knowledge going to be used in the U.S.?
•	


10.	Please provide a more detailed description of employee's prospective duties, activities and responsibilities in the US.



11.	Is the U.S. position part of your original engagement outside of the U.S.?
Yes
13.	If employee will be working from client location, describe how the employee’s work will be controlled and supervised by Genpact 
supervisor?
Employee work in supervision of Genpact supervisor but has also onshore supervisor from client side who assigns work and validate
the research based on his experiace and ad-agencies expectation. Onsite supervisor helps coordinating multiple teams like sales, 
technology, new product solution team and provide continious support and input to the employee. 



14.	If employee will be working from client location, explain the reasons why placement at another worksite outside the petitioner’s 
needed. How employee’s duties at client worksite relate to the need for the specialized knowledge he or she possesses?
•	Client is aquiring more retailers and methodologies to calculate ROI is continiously evolving in the competitive markets. Solution team
is looking for faster development of new methodoligies and evolution of current methodologies. Onsite supervisor needs employee to work
there and provide continious support to meet the speed.
