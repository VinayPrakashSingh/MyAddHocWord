schema. Multiple measures has to be followed for data validations like UPC numbers, prices, quantity of data over the period 
and that it should be in line with other data sets like POS. After retailers data validation, lift studies being performed for 
individual retailers and compare metrics with other retailers of same channel as well as other channels to understand the impact of 
adding new retailers into production.

----------This is related with current postion-----

I majorly work for our US based clients XXX. I am also part of XXXXX Innovation Council who is responsible for developing new solution 
for our client using Open Source, Statistics, Machine Learning and Deep learning.


Q3. What knowledge of XXXXX systems, applications, methodologies and/or procedures does the employee possess that a non-XXXXX employee would not possess? 
•	With my expereince and training I have gained good knowledge of XXXXX proprietary Multi Outlet (MULO) solutions for leading media lift client. 
•	I also have understanding of Media Lift Campaigns and deriving business insights for clients using lift product solutions
•	Knowledge on XXX Retailers data, Frequency Shopper Program, Point of Sale, Experian, methodologies for new retailer onboarding.
•	Designing requirement specification for On-Demand solutions, which helps producing analysis of media campaign in stipulated time and could be accessible by client.
•	Implementation of business methodologies using advance knowledge of open source software R, Julia, Python, Hadoop, Hive, UNIX Shell Scripting and integration of multiple technologies and data exchange to deploy solution.
•	Experties on visualization tools like Tableau, R Shiny and DB platform SQL Server.


Q4	Does employee work on a XXXXX proprietary application, system, technology or methodology?  If yes, please explain in detail and describe how it is proprietary. 
•	Yes, I have designed and developed MULO methodology for media lift studies. 
•	Media lift team delivers ROI due to impact of ads targeted for certain UPCs or brand in US market. It primarily uses exposure 
and FSP (Frequency Shopper Program) data from retailers across US. 
•	Worked on IRI, which provides access of FSP data for few retailers from four outlets and providing lift using only those outlets to 
gives biased ROI. 
•	Getting FSP data for all the retailers is costly so Genpact has developed MULO methodology which uses sales information 
from POS and NCP and uses projection methodology to calculate lift for the missing outlets which helps providing ROI for 
majority of outlets in US.

Q5.	If employee does not work on a proprietary application, does he work on an off-the-shelf application, which is customized for XXXXX?  If so, explain in detail the nature and complexity of the specialized customization for Genpact.

NA



Q6.	Explain how employee's specialized knowledge is significantly different from the knowledge generally applied by other practitioners in the field of activity.

•	Due to better understanding of all available FSP retailers and outlets behaviors in US market helped me laying out the rules 
for MULO. Client is acquiring newer retailers/outlets so the MULO methodologies needs to evovle to accommodate new requirements and this 
is one of the area where I will be working onto. Also, good knowledge of open source software and business rules helps designing 
requirement document for On-Demand solutions. Most of the other team members in MCoE does not know one or other. 


Q7.	How is the employee’s specialized knowledge more advanced than basic or elementary knowledge?
•	I am more close to POS and FSP retailers and developed data prep for media lift studies. I am also continuously part of lift 
delivery and explaining those to onshore. This gradually developed in-depth understanding of FSP/POS data, ad-agencies programs 
and lift. This helped me being core member of new FSP data acquisition, developing and managing existing products with the help of 
evolving open source technologies in market.

growing data size, newer open source to handle such data. Gradual change in methodology needs to be researched and validated. 

Q9.	Why was employee selected for this assignment?
